### Audience: Experience and Experts of OCI Devops.

### Objective

The sample here focuses on updating the deployment environment - instance group dynamically.




Procedure
---

- A **devops environment** is the target platform for your software. You create references to different destination environments for DevOps deployment.

- There will be use cases where you may want to fetch the instances within a defined devops environment based on dynamic add/deletion of new instances.
- Read more about `Managing Environments` [here](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/devops/using/environments.htm).

### Using static declaration of Devops Instance Environment.

- In this case, we will be using the `Filter` method and where in the instances are manually picked.
- Filter mode will not update dynamically against instance addition/deletion.

- Here we manually pick the instances based on our desired choice.

### Using dynamic declaration of devops Instance Environment.

- In this case, we will be using `Query` and adding the desired condition against the possible keys.
- In this way, the instances will be added /updated dynamically.

- Let us see some of the common instance queries.

#### Using a tag

- Add a free form tag to instances and use the same within the query.

```java
freeformTags.key = 'env' && freeformTags.value = 'prod' 
```

- When using the tag always prefer to use the `lifecycleState` to avoid a delay in holding the deployment against a not running instance. As you may know, we can have many instances with the same tag with different stages.

```java
freeformTags.key = 'env' && freeformTags.value = 'prod' && lifecycleState= 'RUNNING'
```
#### Using most commong compute instance attributes.

- Using `availabilityDomain`

```java
availabilityDomain = 'xxxx-AD-X' && lifecycleState = 'RUNNING'
```

- Using `displayName`

```java
displayName =~ 'instance' && lifecycleState= 'RUNNING'
```

- Using `shape`

```java
shape='VM.Standard.E3.Flex'
```

- You may also use various other paramters of instanes like `definedTags`, `lifecycleState`,

#### Operators supports

- All the below operators are supported with instance query syntax.

```java
'.', '=', '!=', '==', '!==', '=~', '!=~', '>', '>=', '<', '<='}
```
